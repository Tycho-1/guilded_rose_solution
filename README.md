## Parametarizing all fixed values
 - max quality
 - min quality
 - step for days past
 
 ## Adding parameters in the main execution sys,argv
 
 ## Dividing the items into categories according to description. Creating inherited classes of the 'normal' Item class
 - special Item type 1 for Brie like items 
 - special Item type 2 for backstage items
 - special Item type 3 for the new item
 - contant Item -> does not change 
 
 
 ## Creating functions to distinguish separate steps of the update process
 - adjust quality
 - decrease days sel in
 - adjust quality when out of date

## Using the distinction based on class in the functions
 - avoiding any hard coded values
